      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <div>Apologies! The /bio route doesn't exist on the server, yet. It's generated client-side by a script that loads with the <a href="https://luisrevillam.github.io/">homepage</a>. I'm currently working on a server-side rendered solution, with Gatsby.js :)</div>
